    <ion-card-content>If a learner would like to
      start an interesting career
      as a technician in todayâ€™s
      highly technological
      area of manufacturing
      engineering, then this
      programme provides the
      necessary knowledge,
      understanding and
      skills. This qualification
      provides access to more
      specialist units and
      therefore broadens and
      deepens the experience
      in preparation for actual
      work situations. The
      learner will learn how to
      perform basic engineering
      operations in a safe
      and efficient manner,
      whilst safeguarding
      the environment. The
      learner will understand
      basic scientific and
      mathematical theories
      and how to apply
      these to manufacturing
      engineering processes
      such as draughting,
      design, problem solving,
      and machining. This
      course includes workrelated training and
      practice.
      Applicants have to be
      able to work within the
      industries concerned.</ion-card-content>
