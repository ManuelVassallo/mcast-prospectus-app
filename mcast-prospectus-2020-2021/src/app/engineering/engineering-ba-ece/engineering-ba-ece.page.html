    <ion-card-content>The aim of this degree
      programme is to develop
      learners into qualified
      engineers who are both
      academically prepared
      and practically trained to
      satisfy the requirements
      of the local electronics
      industry.
      Moreover, these
      graduates will be suitably
      prepared to embark on
      professional careers
      or further their studies
      abroad. Electronics is
      still a highly relevant and
      attractive technological
      field that has evolved at a
      rapid rate.
      This interdisciplinary
      field is practically used in
      every aspect of modern
      life as exemplified by the
      advances in computers
      and communications.
      The course will bring
      learners in contact with
      the modern technologies
      and gives an in depth mix
      of knowledge and skills.</ion-card-content>
