      The MCAST Gozo Campus offers a selection
      of 24 fulltime day courses ranging from MQF
      Levels 1 to 6 and covering a broad spectrum
      of vocational disciplines. Some of these
      programmes lead learners directly to
      employment, whist others lead to higher level
      studies in Gozo and/or Malta.

      In either case,
      learners are thoroughly prepared for their next
      tep, whichever that may be.

      GozoCampus fulfil the same quality assurance
      standards that are applicable to the same
      programmes delivered at the respective
      MCAST Institutes in Malta, ensuring that
      Gozitan students benefit from the same quality
      of service on their home ground.
